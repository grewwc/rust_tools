# Tools Guide

## Scope

Applies to `src/bin/ai/tools/**`.

Read `docs/agent-guides/ai-tools.md` before changing tool registration,
execution policy, sandboxing, path resolution, or progressive loading.

## Key invariants

1. Keep schema/metadata in `registry/`, execution in `service/`, and shared
   helpers/state in `storage/`.
2. Tool names use verb-first snake_case.
3. Relative file paths must resolve against `runtime_ctx::effective_cwd()`.
4. Baseline/progressive-loading behavior should stay explicit; do not silently
   hide required entry-point tools.
5. Prefer structural parsing over brittle string matching in validation paths.
